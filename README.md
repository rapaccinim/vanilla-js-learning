# Vanilla JavaScript Learning Journey
Every Web Developer (like me) should know deeply JavaScript before any fancy framework/library

## Why
During my web development career I worked with many different libraries and frameworks, so I saw with my eyes what real-world projects mean.
That is absolutely good for pure working goals, but I'm starting to feel like I'm missing the core skill of modern web development: understand and know JavaScript in detail.

## A common problem
If you are a web developer, I guess that in 80% of the cases you have the same feeling:
> I think that I really don't understand this JS feature, function or syntax, but we are going in production very soon, so better to look on StackOverlfow to find the latest copy-paste code to use in our amazing framework
Yes, it's terrible. But it is the real world, so better to accept it and try to do something to change this odd feeling.

## About this repo
This repo will be an unsorted set of JavaScript different codes to learn, develop and test basic and advanced stuff.
This way:
* I can expand my JS knowledge
* I'll always have a code reference that I can use when I have a doubt or to avoid making the same mistakes
* As a personal diary, I can see my improvements and gain more and more confidence about what I'm doing (always preserving a critical thinking approach)
* Maybe I could help other (wannabe or senior) developers to learn something more
* I can finally develop pure JS code without 'polluting' it with frameworks/libraries
* I can reflect about the meaning of life through code ðŸ’­
